**Mondrian Project**

Just a small project I made to practice CSS Grid.
Tried to recreate a Mondrian-style painting using only HTML & CSS.

**What I did**

- Set up a grid with fixed sizes

- Matched the colors to Mondrian’s style

- Placed each block using grid-column and grid-row

**How to see it**

Open _index.html_ in your browser and boom — Mondrian art!
